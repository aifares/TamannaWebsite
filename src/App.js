              Hello! My name is Tamanna Inna I graduated Magna Cum Laude from
              the University at Buffalo with a degree in Mathematics and I am
              incoming gradute student at Columbia University. I have a natrual
              affinty for problem solving and take great pride in all my work. I
              posess exemplary leadership skills which I gained from my time as
              Medical assistant at Western New York Dermatology. During my
              undergrad I was also a secretary for the Advocates for Girls'
              Education club. I am now looking to apply these to real world
              problems as I look for technial roles in health and tech field

              The purpose of this artificial intelligence research is to develop
              an artificial intelligence algorithm to diagnose brain metastasis
              in MRI studies. MRI dataset of known brain metastasis will be used
              to create and implement an image-based classifier for autonomously
              detecting brain tumors or other anomalies. Simultaneously, brain
              metastasis classification and detection from MRI images using
              Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on U-Net architecture.
              The success was in measuring the accuracy of the algorithms in
              training and testing the data set.
